# Questions

# 1. How do you estimate the runtime behavior of your implementation in terms of CPU usage and memory consumption?

# 2. How do you approach designing and architecting large-scale Python applications, and what tools or techniques do you use to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance?

# 3. Can you describe your experience working with any Python web frameworks, such as Flask or Django, and how you have used third-party tools or libraries to enhance their functionality?

# 4. Can you discuss your experience with authentication and authorization in API design, and how you have implemented these features in Python?

# 5. What are the pros and cons of deploying applications as a container (e.g. Docker)?

# 6. Suppose you need to continuously roll out an application to several stations in multiple remote locations in different time zones and sometimes unstable/slow internet connections. Service continuity and stability are paramount. Each on-site location has a central server available. How would you make sure that you can roll out updated versions of the application in a timely fashion while interrupting the service as shortly as possible?
